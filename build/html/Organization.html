<div class="section" id="work-space">
<h2>Work Space<a class="headerlink" href="#work-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you open the platform, the Work Space will show you all those research
areas that are supported by a number of bioinformatic workflows each. Clicking
on one of these tiled buttons will open a detailed listing of functions and
pre-composed workflows, which you can launch by directly activating the given
hyperlinks.</p>
<p>The listings of each Area introduce each Chapter of this User Guide that
explains the functionality provided:</p>
<p>| Area              | Chapter | Area                             | Chapter |

<p>The first workflow in nearly any Area is Load data, which is separately
described in <strong>Chapter 3</strong>, before the individual Areas are being depicted.</p>
<p>Also in the Work Space, all major input requirements will have to be done, the
progress of a workflow and the results output will appear here as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tree-area">
<h2>Tree Area<a class="headerlink" href="#tree-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the Tree Area (<strong>B</strong> in the figure of Section 2.1), you find three tabs:
<strong>Databases</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, and <strong>Analyses</strong>. Under each of these tabs, you find a
tree-structured listing of contents: the available databases, the data files to
work with, and the analysis methods you can apply. You can open any subdirectory
by a single mouse click on the respective item and using the button</p>
<p><img alt="media/479e9da75ec5018bda0b7745ed5644f3.emf" src="media/479e9da75ec5018bda0b7745ed5644f3.emf" /></p>
<p>, or by a double-click on the name of the folder to be opened.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="databases">
<h2>Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#databases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Under this tab, you find all databases that are at your disposal: a number of
public databases (yellow symbols) as well as commercial ones that you have a
valid license for (green symbols). Write access may be additionally indicated by
a black “W” within the symbol, which may be red in case that write access,
although principally possible for this database, has not been activated in your
case.</p>
<p>Select one of the databases in the Tree Area by a single click with the left
mouse button; double click will open the subdirectory. For instance, when you
wish to go to GeneWays, you have to click once on the little white triangle next
to the term GeneWays, or double-click on the term itself to open the directory
underneath; either operation, or already a single click onto the name of the
database, suffice to indicate this data resource in the Info Box, along with a
short description.</p>
<p>Presently, by default, you should see the following listing of available
databases:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Databases_02.png" src="images/Databases_02.png" /></p>
<p>How you can work with the different databases will be explained in <strong>Chapter
19</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data">
<h2>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On the tab Data, you will find your own datasets as well as predefined ones in
the directories <strong>Examples</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, and <strong>Public</strong>.</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>Examples</strong>, we provide you with a number of sample data you
may use for getting familiar with the system. Presently, these are some
optimization examples as well as one application example on expression data of
Psoriasis patient samples.</p>
<p>The optimization example refers to the CD95L pathway (<em>Reactome entry
REACT_900</em>), shown as diagram <em>CD95 signaling pathway</em> under Diagrams. Under
Plots, you find an example for a successful parameter optimization
(<em>C3C8_plot</em>), with the dots giving the experimental values for four different
molecules, and the straight lines showing the simulation results.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Opti_03.png" src="images/Opti_03.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="images/Opti_04.jpg" src="images/Opti_04.jpg" /></p>
<p>Under the heading <strong>Projects</strong>, you should initially find only one directory
with your username, with the two subfolders <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Journal</strong>. <strong>Data</strong>
will be the place where all your own data will be deposited. Here, you can
define own subdirectories by opening a context menu with the right mouse button
and selecting the option New folder:</p>
<p><img alt="Creation of new folder" src="images/NewFolder_05.png" /></p>
<p>Each option in this menu can also be selected by the corresponding icon on top
of the tabs.</p>
<p>The sub-directory <strong>Journal</strong> stores a history of your activities. Opening it in
the Work Space shows you a list of all methods that you have previously
launched, including time stamp.</p>
<p>The root directory <strong>Public</strong> is presently not used yet; it is planned to
provide a platform for sharing own results with a wider community at a later
stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analyses">
<h2>Analyses<a class="headerlink" href="#analyses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>On this tab, you find <strong>Galaxy</strong> tools, <strong>JavaScript</strong> functions, all
<strong>Methods</strong> you may apply using the geneXplain platform, including the
pre-defined <strong>Workflows</strong>:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Analyses_06.png" src="images/Analyses_06.png" /></p>
<p>In the directory <strong>Galaxy</strong>, there are sorted groups of tools for mainly RNA-seq
and NGS data. Additionally, collections of statistical applications, gene fusion
finder, human genome variant detector and effect predictor. You will also find
the MatrixCatch, a tool designed to search for potential composite elements
(CEs) in DNA sequences.</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a collection of scripts have been gathered that
all can be called by your own scripts. The geneXplain platform provides you with
the possibility to create your own scripts on the Script tab in the Operations
Field. For instance, enter there the command “help (boxPlot);” (boxPlot is the
first JavaScript in the subdirectory <strong>Functions</strong>) and press Execute (or just
Enter): Some help text about boxPlot will be printed to the Work Space:</p>
<p><img alt="Javascript" src="images/Javascript_07.png" /></p>
<p>Under <strong>Functions</strong>, a number of standard JavaScript functions are listed,
whereas in the subdirectory <strong>Host object</strong>, a collection of scripts have been
put together that were specifically developed for the gXp platform.</p>
<p>The directory <strong>Methods</strong> contains all individual tools, or Bricks, that perform
specific tasks in one of the listed areas. A full listing of all analysis
methods that are presently available is given in the <a class="reference external" href="http://platform.genexplain.com/help/index.html?analysis_methods.htm">Help
texts</a>.
Each method can be launched either by double-clicking on the respective item,
which will open the corresponding input mask in the Work Space, or through the
context menu that you can open with a right-button mouse click on the method of
interest.</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>Workflows</strong>, you find basically the same functional groups of
pre-defined workflows that are also listed on the Start page of the platform
(Work Space). Please note that the first two items on the Start page are
important preparatory tasks, but not workflows according to the definition of
the geneXplain platform. Please, refer to the following Chapters for operating
the pre-defined workflows and to Chapter 22 for creating your own workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-info-box">
<h2>The Info Box<a class="headerlink" href="#the-info-box" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Info Box shows two tabs, <strong>Info</strong> and <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="info-tab">
<h3>Info tab<a class="headerlink" href="#info-tab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Under the Info tab, you will find short descriptions about the database, data
file or analysis method that you have clicked in the Tree Area. In many cases,
you will just see the name of the directory or file as <strong>ID</strong>, or the complete
path displayed in the field <strong>Complete name</strong>, and the number of subdirectories
and files right under the activated node as <strong>Size</strong>.</p>
<p>The information shown on the Info tab can be viewed in a separate window by
clicking the button <img alt="media/23aa661e8a1703b9be7a7b23c58495ec.emf" src="media/23aa661e8a1703b9be7a7b23c58495ec.emf" />. In case the activated file is a table (icon<img alt="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" src="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" /> or derived images; see 25.2.3), the number of rows in the table will be
indicated as Size. Optionally, a <strong>Description</strong> is shown as well, depending on
whether it has been entered when the file was generated. By clicking on the icon <img alt="media/ae8f91dec92cdd11babcd95a4f48ecb0.emf" src="media/ae8f91dec92cdd11babcd95a4f48ecb0.emf" /> , you may edit some of the information in a newly opened window. Depending on the file type, the edit window may look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Edit_08.png" src="images/Edit_08.png" /></p>
<p>Gray fields cannot be edited, contents of fields with white background can be
changed manually, additional information can be entered in the pink fields which
will then appear on the Info tab, if the changes made are saved afterwards with
the [Save] button of the Edit window.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of directory or file that you have activated in the Tree
Area, different types of information can be selected for the display on the Info
tab. This can be done by the selection box right to the tabs in the Info Box,
initially always showing “Default”:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Edit_09.png" src="images/Edit_09.png" /></p>
<p>Please, feel encouraged to find out the effects of the different views offered
here.When you have a network diagram opened in the Work Space (<strong>A</strong> in the figure of chapter 2) and you select a molecule or reaction with one click, you find
information about the selected element in the Info box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search">
<h3>Search<a class="headerlink" href="#search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As long as you are under the tabs Data or Analyses in the Tree Area, you see
here only the message “Select database to search in …, maybe along with fields
and data from an earlier search.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Search_01.png" src="images/Search_01.png" /></p>
<p>This field gets activated as soon as you go to the tab Databases in the Tree
Area, and then click on one of the databases listed there. For instance, when
you wish to go to GeneWays, you have to click once on the little white triangle
next to the term GeneWays, or double-click on the term itself to open the
directory underneath; either operation, or already a single click onto the name
of the database, suffices to indicate this data resource in the Info Box:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Search_02.png" src="images/Search_02.png" /></p>
<p>You can insert your search term (e.g., a gene symbol) into the field underneath.
Clicking on the icon</p>
<p><img alt="media/128ee81ad2100c1fcef053ce5f783d49.emf" src="media/128ee81ad2100c1fcef053ce5f783d49.emf" /></p>
<p>launches the search. The search routine scans for exact matches, but use of
wildcards is possible. Thus, searching for elk* returns results for elk1,
elk2p1, elk3, and elk4.</p>
<p>The results will be shown in the Operations Field, under the tab Search result.
For instance, when searching in GeneWays for JAG1, the following result table
will be displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Search_03.png" src="images/Search_03.png" /></p>
<p>The search term is highlighted in bold.</p>
<p>In some cases, the search results can be narrowed down by further specifying the
search space in the Info Box.</p>
<p>More about how to operate the individual databases will be explained in <strong>Chapter
19</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-operations-field">
<h3>The Operations Field<a class="headerlink" href="#the-operations-field" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the <strong>Operations Field</strong> (<strong>D</strong> in the figure of the Section introduction
2.1) a number of essential functions to operate the geneXplain platform are
provided on a number of tabs. How many and which tabs are shown depends very
much on the context.</p>
<p>Please note that not all tabs are always visible due to space constraints. In
these cases, double arrowheads left and right of the tabs indicate that there
are additional ones, reachable by clicking on these double arrowheads.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Operations.png" src="images/Operations.png" /></p>
<p>The function of the individual tabs will be explained in more detail in those
sections where their effect is part of a certain operation. The full range of
functions that you can make use of in the Operations Field is explained in
greater detail in <strong>Chapter 21.</strong></p>

<h3>User Project, Data folder, creating new folders<a class="headerlink" href="#user-project-data-folder-creating-new-folders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you enter your account for the first time, you can see the following three
folders in the Tree Area under the <em>Data</em> tab (red oval on the picture below):
Examples, Projects and Public. Each of these folders can be expanded by clicking
on the small triangle on the left side of the folder name (green oval on the
picture below).</p>
<p>The folder <strong>Projects</strong> is your folder in the tree where you are going to make
all the analyses.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Project_01.png" src="images/Project_01.png" /></p>
<p>If you expand the Project folder, you can see the project that was created upon
registration of your account
(<img alt="media/ab0f0406eb982519b2b38b759586bf59.png" src="media/ab0f0406eb982519b2b38b759586bf59.png" />), and if you expand it further, you can see the folder Data. This location,
<em>data/Projects/User project/Data/</em> is exactly the location where you can upload
your data, and save all the analysis results.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Project_02.png" src="images/Project_02.png" /></p>
<p>Upon one mouse click on the folder Data, as in the picture above, you can apply
the button <img alt="media/14ec1077a2c1ea580222571519821744.emf" src="media/14ec1077a2c1ea580222571519821744.emf" /> from the top control menu to create a new folder within the selected one.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Project_03.png" src="images/Project_03.png" /></p>
<p>In this way, you can define the hierarchical organization of your folders and
sub-folders within your project, for example as shown below.</p>
<p>Every time when you run a workflow, you need to specify a location of the
results folder, and you can specify any particular location within your project
area.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Project_04.png" src="images/Project_04.png" /></p>
<p>There are two other folders available for you initially, Examples and Public.
The folder <strong>Examples</strong> contains pre-analyzed publicly available data sets,
which you are welcome to have a look through our examples. You can copy tables
or tracks from these two folders into your project area and use them, for
example, for test runs.</p>
<p><img alt="Examples in the tool" src="images/Examples.png" /></p>
<p>The Public folder contains publicly available data sets which might be useful to
apply for various analysis purposes.</p>
<p>![](/images/Public Folder.png)</p>
<p>All users have read access to the folders Examples and Public, but no write
access. You cannot save any files directly in the Examples or Public folder.
However, you can copy tables and tracks from these two folders into your project
area and then modify and work with them as you like.</p>

Here, you can create a user-specific toolbar with your most frequently used
analysis methods, workflows and datasets. To create your own toolbar you can
drag and drop your favorite workflows and files for which you often need a quick
access into the Control Panel. The User tool bar will then be located at the top
right top corner, highlighted by a red oval in the screenshot below.</p>
<p>To add any analysis method/workflow/gene set, open the respective method in the
Tree Area or in the Work Space and drag &amp; drop it onto the user toolbar as shown
below.</p>
<p><img alt="images/UserBar.png" src="images/UserBar.png" /></p>
<p>You can quickly open your favorite items from this icon menu. To open any
method, place the cursor on the symbol and you get the complete name of the
method which can be clicked to open in the workspace as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="User Tool Bar" src="images/UserBar_01.png" /></p>
<p>In the above screenshot, the method ‘Site search on gene set’ has been opened
through the user toolbar. If you want to remove any method from the user
toolbar, right click the symbol and you will get an option ‘REMOVE’.</p>
<p>Project properties, or how to fix the releases of the databases to be applied in
user’s projects</p>
<p>The GeneXplain platform provides access to several versions of the databases
installed.</p>
<p>You can select your desired version of the database and fix it for your project
using the <em>Project properties</em> feature. By default the latest version of all
databases are applied.</p>
<p>Project Properties form can be opened via the button <img alt="media/9e17a94280337bb2f0bafbaee53097e1.png" src="media/9e17a94280337bb2f0bafbaee53097e1.png" /> in the control panel:</p>
<p><img alt="images/PP_01.png" src="images/PP_01.png" /></p>
<p>The form opens as shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="images/PP_02.png" src="images/PP_02.png" /></p>
<p>For each database shown in the form, the available versions can be selected
using the drop down menu. As shown below, Ensembl (Homo sapiens) 84.38 database
version is selected. After selection press [Save] and the selected version of
the database will be used in this project for all the analyses.</p>
<p><img alt="images/PP_03.png" src="images/PP_03.png" /></p>
<p>Important to note, this change is applied for one selected project, the project
name is shown on the top of the form, highlighted by the red oval on the picture
above. If you have several projects, you can fix database versions for each
project individually.</p>

<p>All analysis tools, and likewise all prepared workflows, require input data from
a file in the Tree Area. The respective file can be loaded into an analysis tool
by</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>simple dragging-and-dropping of the file from the Tree Area into the
corresponding field in the Work Space, or</li>
<li>by clicking into this field and making the selection from the directory
which opens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multiple selections can be done only in the second way.</p>

<div class="section" id="file-handling-in-the-tree-area">
<h4>File handling in the Tree Area<a class="headerlink" href="#file-handling-in-the-tree-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>On mouse-over, the file name will gain a faint-bluish background. Upon a single
click on a file name, its background will turn into a persistent light blue, and
information about this file will be displayed in the Info Box. Double-clicking
on a file will open it under a new tab in the Work Space, and the file name will
be additionally emphasized by bold lettering as long as the corresponding tab is
in the Work Space’s foreground. Only files with an icon attached can be opened
this way.</p>
<p>Files can also be opened by right-clicking on them and selecting the “Open
table” option. You can also delete files (“Remove”; default value is “No”) this
way. Both functions are also available through the corresponding icons (<img alt="media/0b60d59819bc65a21b99b68ded60108f.gif" src="media/0b60d59819bc65a21b99b68ded60108f.gif" />open.gif and <img alt="media/0196ec0a9b06797265d023f921811da8.gif" src="media/0196ec0a9b06797265d023f921811da8.gif" />remove_de.gif , resp.) in the Control Panel on top of the different frames.</p>
<p>While opening and deleting files works for nearly any file, the third option is
different among distinct file types:
<strong>Tables</strong> (<img alt="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" src="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" /> &gt;   and derivatives) can be exported. When activating this function, a selection of different formats is provided for the file to be generated. It is also available through the icon     <img alt="media/7b51f8cb4f6fd7797bc3872a20a42599.gif" src="media/7b51f8cb4f6fd7797bc3872a20a42599.gif" /> on top of the Tree Area.</p>

<p><strong>Plots</strong> (<img alt="media/e16c5085d2766bce7561c588951ab4c0.emf" src="media/e16c5085d2766bce7561c588951ab4c0.emf" />) can be edited. Only under this option, their complete deletion is possible as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tables">
<h3>Tables<a class="headerlink" href="#tables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Any table may be opened by double-clicking the corresponding name in the Tree
Area. It will open under a new tab in the Work Space.</p>
<p>The contents of the table are sorted according to the values in one of its
columns. Being opened for the first time, a default column is defined for
sorting, usually the ID column. This default column is indicated by a blue
arrowhead. If this arrowhead points upwards, the table rows are sorted in
ascending order of this column’s values. Clicking on this arrowhead will change
it into a downwards pointing one, while the values are sorted in descending
order. Correspondingly, you may sort the table according to the values of any
other column in ascending or descending order by clicking on the up- or
downwards pointing gray arrowhead on top of this column, respectively.</p>
<p>On top of the table, you can navigate between the individual pages of the table;
it is also shown on which page out of how many pages in total you are, and in
the right top corner, the page size in terms of number of entries (rows) is
shown and can be adjusted.</p>
<p>You can edit the contents of a table by pressing the [Edit] button in the right
upper corner. Now, you can manually edit the contents of each cell in the table.
With the [Apply] option, you will save this change, while [Cancel] quits it.</p>
<p>Even without activating the Edit function, you can select</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>individual rows with a left-mouse click,</li>
<li>several ones by keeping the Ctrl key pressed,</li>
<li>a range of rows with the Shift key pressed when clicking on the last row of
the range to be selected, or</li>
<li>[Select all] by clicking on the corresponding button.</li>
</ul>
<p>The selected rows can be saved as a separate file, which by default is given the
name <em>&lt;original file name&gt; subset</em>, but you can change this name.</p>

in the work space in the genome browser.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Tracks_01.png" src="images/Tracks_01.png" /></p>
<p>In the pop-up window <em>Add tracks to genome browser</em> you can select which tracks,
among those available in Ensembl, should be opened together with your track.
Here, three tracks are selected, <em>GC-content</em>, <em>Genes</em>, and <em>Variations</em>. When
the selection is ready, push the [Ok] to get the following view with your track
on top:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Tracks_02.png" src="images/Tracks_02.png" /></p>
<p>On the tab name you can see genome, species and build information for this
track, highlighted by the red oval.</p>
<p>The small triangles on the right side of the track name can be used to jump to
the next or previous site of this track:</p>
<p><img alt="images/Tracks_03.PNG" src="images/Tracks_03.PNG" /></p>
<p>Use the buttons <img alt="images/Tracks_04.png" src="images/Tracks_04.png" /> in the top control menu to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>The buttons <img alt="images/Tracks_05.png" src="images/Tracks_05.png" /> help to shift the visible part to the left or to the right. The same effect can be also achieved by dragging the picture with the mouse.</p>
<p>You can also jump between different chromosomes by selecting the chromosome
number in the field <em>Sequence (chromosome)</em>.</p>
<p>As the next step to enrich the visualization, and to gather more information
about your track of interest, you can add the additional pre-existing tracks
from the folder <em>Public</em>. There, you can find a sub-folder traXplain with
several tracks. This sub-folder is highlighted in blue in the screenshot below.
As an example, two tracks have been added, the track with DNAse hypersensitive
sites from the ENCODE project (<em>DNAse HS sites clustered ENCODE UCSC hg19</em>), and
the track with the experimentally proven transcription factor binding sites from
the TRANSFAC® database (<em>TRANSFAC 2013.4 human sites hg19</em>).</p>

<h3>Diagram handling<a class="headerlink" href="#diagram-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Diagrams are provided by a number of databases and tools in the platform. The
general schema of their use is that an overview of the corresponding graph is
shown in the Operation Field, under the tab Overview, while a full-sized picture
is shown in the Work Space, where usually only a part of the whole diagram fits
on the screen. The diagrams exhibit components as ovals, reactions as squares,
and links as lines or arrows.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Diagram_01.png" src="images/Diagram_01.png" /></p>
<p>The section displayed can be shifted either in the Work Space by moving the
mouse pointer (hand symbol) keeping the left mouse button pressed, or by
shifting the blue-dotted rectangle in the Operation Field (mouse over: pointer
symbol turns into a <strong>four-arrow plus sign</strong>, shifting can be performed while
keeping the left mouse button pressed).</p>
<p>To facilitate orientation in large diagrams, individual edges are highlighted
(turning from a thin, usually black arrow into a thick light-blue one).</p>
<p>Double-click on an individual node will show information about this component
under the Info tab of the Info Box (this works for BioModels).</p>
<p>Diagrams can be zoomed in and zoomed out, by click on the buttons
<img alt="media/65b191751b9996cc91860bdf1bdc58f0.png" src="media/65b191751b9996cc91860bdf1bdc58f0.png" /> or

<p><img alt="images/Diagram_03.png" src="images/Diagram_03.png" /></p>
<p>Diagram nodes can be multi-selected via the [Ctrl] button (picture below).
Selected nodes can be used for <em>Alignments</em> or <em>Distribution</em> editing within the
diagram or can be saved as a subset.</p>
<p>Five alignment methods are available in the tool bar (see picture below) after
opening a diagram in the workspace.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Diagram_04.png" src="images/Diagram_04.png" /></p>
<p>After pushing one of the buttons in the toolbar, the selected nodes in the
diagram are aligned accordingly. The picture below shows an <em>Up alignment</em> of
all nodes.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Diagram_05.png" src="images/Diagram_05.png" /></p>
<p>Two distribution methods horizontally <img alt="media/9e7d2ff171070050fd2e2786ea7e7442.png" src="media/9e7d2ff171070050fd2e2786ea7e7442.png" /> and vertically

pushing one of the buttons in the toolbar, the selected nodes in the diagram are
positioned accordingly. The picture below shows a <em>Vertically distribution</em> of
one node.</p>
<p><img alt="images/Diagram_06.png" src="images/Diagram_06.png" /></p>
<p>For edge editing you can use either the dialog box or a clickable connecting
