<div class="section" id="work-space">
<h3>Work Space<a class="headerlink" href="#work-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you open the platform, the Work Space will show you all those research
areas that are supported by a number of bioinformatic workflows each. Clicking
on one of these tiled buttons will open a detailed listing of functions and
pre-composed workflows, which you can launch by directly activating the given
hyperlinks.</p>
<p>The listings of each Area introduce each Chapter of this User Guide that
explains the functionality provided:</p>
<p>| Area              | Chapter | Area                             | Chapter |

<p>The first workflow in nearly any Area is Load data, which is separately
described in <strong>Chapter-3</strong>, before the individual Areas are being depicted.</p>
<p>Also in the Work Space, all major input requirements will have to be done, the
progress of a workflow and the results output will appear here as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tree-area">
<h3>Tree Area<a class="headerlink" href="#tree-area" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the Tree Area (<strong>B</strong> in the figure of Section 2.1), you find three tabs:
<strong>Databases</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, and <strong>Analyses</strong>. Under each of these tabs, you find a
tree-structured listing of contents: the available databases, the data files to
work with, and the analysis methods you can apply. You can open any subdirectory
by a single mouse click on the respective item and using the button</p>
<p><img alt="image/image_001" src="image/image_001" /></p>
<p>, or by a double-click on the name of the folder to be opened.</p>
<div class="section" id="databases">
<h4>Databases<a class="headerlink" href="#databases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Under this tab, you find all databases that are at your disposal: a number of
public databases (yellow symbols) as well as commercial ones that you have a
valid license for (green symbols). Write access may be additionally indicated by
a black “W” within the symbol, which may be red in case that write access,
although principally possible for this database, has not been activated in your
case.</p>
<p>Select one of the databases in the Tree Area by a single click with the left
mouse button; double click will open the subdirectory. For instance, when you
wish to go to GeneWays, you have to click once on the little white triangle next
to the term GeneWays, or double-click on the term itself to open the directory
underneath; either operation, or already a single click onto the name of the
database, suffice to indicate this data resource in the Info Box, along with a
short description.</p>
<p>Presently, by default, you should see the following listing of available
databases:</p>
<p><img alt="media/f8076deca758ee37388bfac039487e40.png" src="media/f8076deca758ee37388bfac039487e40.png" /></p>
<p>How you can work with the different databases will be explained in
<strong>Chapter19</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="data">
<h4>Data<a class="headerlink" href="#data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>On the tab Data, you will find your own datasets as well as predefined ones in
the directories <strong>Examples</strong>, <strong>Projects</strong>, and <strong>Public</strong>.</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>Examples</strong>, we provide you with a number of sample data you
may use for getting familiar with the system. Presently, these are some
optimization examples as well as one application example on expression data of
Psoriasis patient samples.</p>
<p>The optimization example refers to the CD95L pathway (<em>Reactome entry
REACT_900</em>), shown as diagram <em>CD95 signaling pathway</em> under Diagrams. Under
Plots, you find an example for a successful parameter optimization
(<em>C3C8_plot</em>), with the dots giving the experimental values for four different
molecules, and the straight lines showing the simulation results.</p>
<p>Under the heading <strong>Projects</strong>, you should initially find only one directory
with your username, with the two subfolders <strong>Data</strong> and <strong>Journal</strong>. <strong>Data</strong>
will be the place where all your own data will be deposited. Here, you can
define own subdirectories by opening a context menu with the right mouse button
and selecting the option New folder:</p>
<p>Each option in this menu can also be selected by the corresponding icon on top
of the tabs.</p>
<p>The sub-directory <strong>Journal</strong> stores a history of your activities. Opening it in
the Work Space shows you a list of all methods that you have previously
launched, including time stamp.</p>
<p>The root directory <strong>Public</strong> is presently not used yet; it is planned to
provide a platform for sharing own results with a wider community at a later
stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analyses">
<h4>Analyses<a class="headerlink" href="#analyses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>On this tab, you find all methods you may apply using the geneXplain platform,
including the pre-defined workflows:</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>JavaScript</strong>, a collection of scripts have been gathered that
all can be called by your own scripts. The geneXplain platform provides you with
the possibility to create your own scripts on the Script tab in the Operations
Field. For instance, enter there the command “help (boxPlot);” (boxPlot is the
first JavaScript in the subdirectory <strong>Functions</strong>) and press Execute (or just
Enter): Some help text about boxPlot will be printed to the Work Space:</p>
<p>Under <strong>Functions</strong>, a number of standard JavaScript functions are listed,
whereas in the subdirectory <strong>Host object</strong>, a collection of scripts have been
put together that were specifically developed for the gXp platform.</p>
<p>The directory <strong>Methods</strong> contains all individual tools, or Bricks, that perform
specific tasks in one of the listed areas. Each method can be launched either by
double-clicking on the respective item, which will open the corresponding input
mask in the Work Space, or through the context menu that you can open with a
right-button mouse click on the method of interest.</p>
<p>In the directory <strong>Workflows</strong>, you find basically the same functional groups of
pre-defined workflows that are also listed on the Start page of the platform
(Work Space). Please note that the first two items on the Start page are
important preparatory tasks, but not workflows according to the definition of
the geneXplain platform. Please, refer to the following Chapters for operating
the pre-defined workflows and to <strong>Chapter22</strong> for creating your own
workflows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-info-box">
<h3>The Info Box<a class="headerlink" href="#the-info-box" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Info Box shows two tabs, <strong>Info</strong> and <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="info-tab">
<h4>Info tab<a class="headerlink" href="#info-tab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Under the Info tab, you will find short descriptions about the database, data
file or analysis method that you have clicked in the Tree Area. In many cases,
you will just see the name of the directory or file as <strong>ID</strong>, or the complete
path displayed in the field <strong>Complete name</strong>, and the number of subdirectories
and files right under the activated node as <strong>Size</strong>.</p>
<p>The information shown on the Info tab can be viewed in a separate window by
clicking the button</p>
<p><img alt="media/23aa661e8a1703b9be7a7b23c58495ec.emf" src="media/23aa661e8a1703b9be7a7b23c58495ec.emf" /></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In case the activated file is a table (icon</p>
<p><img alt="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" src="media/d373ccf59d81fcd62088646e06661e33.emf" /></p>
<p>or derived images; see 25.2.3), the number of rows in the table will be
indicated as Size. Optionally, a <strong>Description</strong> is shown as well, depending on
whether it has been entered when the file was generated. By clicking on the icon</p>
<p><img alt="media/ae8f91dec92cdd11babcd95a4f48ecb0.emf" src="media/ae8f91dec92cdd11babcd95a4f48ecb0.emf" /></p>
<p>, you may edit some of the information in a newly opened window. Depending on
the file type, the edit window may look like this:</p>
<p>Gray fields cannot be edited, contents of fields with white background can be
changed manually, additional information can be entered in the pink fields which
will then appear on the Info tab, if the changes made are saved afterwards with
the [Save] button of the Edit window.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of directory or file that you have activated in the Tree
Area, different types of information can be selected for the display on the Info
tab. This can be done by the selection box right to the tabs in the Info Box,
initially always showing “Default”:</p>
<p><img alt="media/7b819f03991b4590ebe48669f432b4d5.emf" src="media/7b819f03991b4590ebe48669f432b4d5.emf" /></p>
<p>Please, feel encouraged to find out the effects of the different views offered
here.</p>
<p>When you have a network diagram opened in the Work Space (<strong>A</strong> in the figure of
chapter 2) and you select a molecule or reaction with one click, you find
information about the selected element in the Info box.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="search">
<h4>Search<a class="headerlink" href="#search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As long as you are under the tabs Data or Analyses in the Tree Area, you see
here only the message “Select database to search in …, maybe along with fields
and data from an earlier search.</p>
<p><img alt="media/6e8f79179d62cc58f0fe7fd2c7a1e3b1.png" src="media/6e8f79179d62cc58f0fe7fd2c7a1e3b1.png" /></p>
<p>This field gets activated as soon as you go to the tab Databases in the Tree
Area, and then click on one of the databases listed there. For instance, when
you wish to go to GeneWays, you have to click once on the little white triangle
next to the term GeneWays, or double-click on the term itself to open the
directory underneath; either operation, or already a single click onto the name
of the database, suffices to indicate this data resource in the Info Box:</p>
<p><img alt="media/5ba9394685b6c3af7cac56dab9ca5652.png" src="media/5ba9394685b6c3af7cac56dab9ca5652.png" /></p>
<p>You can insert your search term (e.g., a gene symbol) into the field underneath.
Clicking on the icon</p>
<p><img alt="media/128ee81ad2100c1fcef053ce5f783d49.emf" src="media/128ee81ad2100c1fcef053ce5f783d49.emf" /></p>
<p>launches the search. The search routine scans for exact matches, but use of
wildcards is possible. Thus, searching for elk* returns results for elk1,
elk2p1, elk3, and elk4.</p>
<p>The results will be shown in the Operations Field, under the tab Search result.
For instance, when searching in GeneWays for JAG1, the following result table
will be displayed:</p>
<p><img alt="media/cbf6dfcdd516d010e3db5502af3a3021.png" src="media/cbf6dfcdd516d010e3db5502af3a3021.png" /></p>
<p>The search term is highlighted in bold.</p>
<p>In some cases, the search results can be narrowed down by further specifying the
search space in the Info Box.</p>
<p>More about how to operate the individual databases will be explained in
<strong>Chapter19</strong>.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="the-operations-field">
<h3>The Operations Field<a class="headerlink" href="#the-operations-field" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the <strong>Operations Field</strong> (<strong>D</strong> in the figure of the Section introduction
2.1) a number of essential functions to operate the geneXplain platform are
provided on a number of tabs. How many and which tabs are shown depends very
much on the context.</p>
<p>Please note that not all tabs are always visible due to space constraints. In
these cases, double arrowheads left and right of the tabs indicate that there
are additional ones, reachable by clicking on these double arrowheads.</p>

<p>The function of the individual tabs will be explained in more detail in those
sections where their effect is part of a certain operation. In general, the icon</p>
<p><img alt="media/fc66a907dd4b019161a894cdb645178e.emf" src="media/fc66a907dd4b019161a894cdb645178e.emf" /></p>

<h3>User Project, Data folder, creating new folders<a class="headerlink" href="#user-project-data-folder-creating-new-folders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you enter your account for the first time, you can see the following three
folders in the Tree Area under the <em>Data</em> tab (red oval on the picture below):
Examples, Projects and Public. Each of these folders can be expanded by clicking
on the small triangle on the left side of the folder name (green oval on the
picture below).</p>
<p>The folder Projects is your folder in the tree where you are going to make all
the analyses.</p>
<p><img alt="media/ac799659784927465044fc3129b9eca6.png" src="media/ac799659784927465044fc3129b9eca6.png" /></p>
<p>If you expand the Project folder, you can see the project that was created upon
registration of your account (</p>
<p><img alt="media/ab0f0406eb982519b2b38b759586bf59.png" src="media/ab0f0406eb982519b2b38b759586bf59.png" /></p>
<p>), and if you expand it further, you can see the folder Data. This location,
<em>data/Projects/User project/Data/</em> is exactly the location where you can upload
your data and save all the analysis results.</p>
<p><img alt="media/7faf3da3fad98291d69fa75a3654cdaa.png" src="media/7faf3da3fad98291d69fa75a3654cdaa.png" /></p>
<p>Upon one mouse click on the folder Data, as in the picture above, you can apply
the button</p>
<p><img alt="media/14ec1077a2c1ea580222571519821744.emf" src="media/14ec1077a2c1ea580222571519821744.emf" /></p>

<p>In this way, you can define the hierarchical organization of your folders and
sub-folders within your project, for example as shown below.</p>
<p>Every time when you run a workflow, you need to specify a location of the
results folder, and you can specify any particular location within your project
area.</p>
<p><img alt="media/2ee4bf909d50d1da26a29d5d540eb5a0.png" src="media/2ee4bf909d50d1da26a29d5d540eb5a0.png" /></p>
<p>There are two other folders available for you initially, Examples and Public.
The folder Examples contains pre-analyzed publicly available data sets, which
you are welcome to have a look through our examples. You can copy tables or
tracks from these two folders into your project area and use them, for example,
for test runs.</p>
<p><img alt="media/65fc35b9c6bb79fbdc1e8c32e7b651d4.png" src="media/65fc35b9c6bb79fbdc1e8c32e7b651d4.png" /></p>
<p>The Public folder contains publicly available data sets which might be useful to
apply for various analysis purposes.</p>
<p><img alt="media/b14d62bdfbaab80e366067403215dbe7.png" src="media/b14d62bdfbaab80e366067403215dbe7.png" /></p>
<p>All users have read access to the folders Examples and Public, but no write
access. You cannot save any files directly in the Examples or Public folder.
However, you can copy tables and tracks from these two folders into your project
area and then modify and work with them as you like.</p>

columns. Being opened for the first time, a default column is defined for
sorting, usually the ID column. This default column is indicated by a blue
arrowhead. If this arrowhead points upwards, the table rows are sorted in
ascending order of this column’s values. Clicking on this arrowhead will change
it into a downwards pointing one, while the values are sorted in descending
order. Correspondingly, you may sort the table according to the values of any
other column in ascending or descending order by clicking on the up- or
downwards pointing gray arrowhead on top of this column, respectively.</p>
<p>On top of the table, you can navigate between the individual pages of the table;
it is also shown on which page out of how many pages in total you are, and in
the right top corner, the page size in terms of number of entries (rows) is
shown and can be adjusted.</p>
<p>You can edit the contents of a table by pressing the [Edit] button in the right
